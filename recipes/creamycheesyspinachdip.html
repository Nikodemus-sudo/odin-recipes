        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Some cheesy dip for anything you'd like to dip. I dunno, I never made it</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen spinach - thawed, drained, and chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>6 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 dashes Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, 4 to 7 minutes. Add spinach and simmer until spinach is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain any liquid from the mixture and transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into pot and return pot to medium heat. Melt cream cheese into the milk; cook and stir together about 3 minutes. Return spinach mixture to pot with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese; stir to combine. Season the mixture with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
